# There are four types of lines in this format, comment, label, course, and meeting

# Comment is what you have been seeing until now, they are the lines starting with # and they are to be ignored by the program, used for documentation purposes

* Test File

# Course is the definition of a course, thus its entry in the database will be opened and it will be able to recive meetings
# Its format is CODE, NAME, INSTRUCTOR where 
#### CODE is the code of the course that will be used to identify it, 
#### NAME is the full name of the course used only in the table, 
#### and INSTRUCTOR is the name of the instructor who is going to be teaching that course, also only appearng in the table, 
# the feilds must be comma separated ex.

# Meeting is the definition of a meeting of a PREVIOUSLY DEFINED course
# Its format is CODE, DAY, START, END, LOC where 
#### CODE is the previously defined code,
#### DAY is a three letter abbreiation of a day with only the first letter being capital ex. Mon , 
#### START and END are the stating and the ending times of the course respectively in the format of HHMM in 24-h system ex. 1330 (which is 1:30 PM), 
#### and LOC is an optional feild setting the location of the meeting
# the feilds must be comma separated ex.
